# medica_consult

Combing both enginnering and medical fields, MedicaConsult was conceived as a solution to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare providers.
This mobile application provides a platform for patients to connect with healthcare professionals remotely, enabling consultations via video calls, chat, or phone.
It offers a range of services, from booking appointments and prescribing medication to enabling online payment and having an all-time access to medical health information.
Benefiting from pharmaceutical partnerships, the platform facilitates the home delivery of medicines, ensuring patients receive their medications promptly and safely without needing to visit a pharmacy.
